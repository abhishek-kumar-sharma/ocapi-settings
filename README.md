# OCAPI Settings for Salesforce Commerce APIs Beta Program
## What it is for?
The settings in this file serve as a sample on how ressource based client permissions need to be set as an OCAPI setting to represent the endpoints of the new commerce APIs that can be found in the new commerce cloud development center and to control access of your application to those ressources.

## How to use?
Copy the content of the file - or parts of the file that represent your endpoint usage - and paste it into the OCAPI settings in your Business Manager of your connected commerce cloud ecom instance.

The set of permissions references a complete set of endpoints.
